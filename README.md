# homework1

So for this homework assignment, I changed some elements in the HTML to be more specific. Changed some divs to nav, main, aside, footer, and sections.

I also added alt tags to the photos. 

I made the link in the header section work.

I labeled the CSS sections so it would be easier to find the section you're looking for. 

I also consolidated a lot of the CSS by getting rid of unnecessary extra text and consolidating similar selectors into the same sections, separated with commas.
